            Hi Everyone, my name is <span className="purple">David Daill√®re </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Angers, France</span>.
            <br />
            I'm a junior front-end developer. When I'm not busy working on a project, I like to learn new skills on CodeCademy. My end goal is to become a Full-Stack engineer.
            <br />
            <br />
            I share my time between France and Sri Lanka,
            I like to get up early and start the day surfing, exercising or just taking a walk. Once back home and full of oxygen, I like to stretch, have a cup of coffee and start working :)
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
